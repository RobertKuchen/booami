Description: Implements component-wise gradient boosting for multiply imputed
    datasets. The main contribution is MIBoost, a novel algorithm that enforces
    uniform variable selection across imputations by minimizing an aggregated
    loss function. For comparison, the package also supports per-dataset boosting
    with pooling via estimate averaging or selection-frequency thresholding.
    Includes a leakage-avoiding cross-validation framework that imputes training
    and validation data separately to select the optimal number of boosting
    iterations. Supports Gaussian and logistic loss.
